This project expoits the phenomena of persistence of vision associated with human eye to display text using an array of just 5 LEDs. Persistence of vision is the property of vision due to which the sensation of image formed on retina of our eyes persists in our brain for 1/10  sec. If any other image is formed on retina before that then we are unable to differentiate between those images.
